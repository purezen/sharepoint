Depending on the environment\r\nyou're working in, either open `config/environments/development.rb` or `config/environments/production.rb`.\r\nUncomment the following lines and fill in the correct settings of your mail server:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp\r\nconfig.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {\r\n  :address => 'mailhost',\r\n  :port => 587,\r\n  :user_name => 'user_name',\r\n  :password => 'password',\r\n  :authentication => 'plain'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso uncomment the following and replace `localhost:3000` with the host name the app will be running under:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, you have to choose the address emails will be sent from. You can do\r\nthis by uncommenting and adjusting the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActionMailer::Base.default :from => 'Sharepoint <yourname@yourdomain.com>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nContributors:\r\n\r\n * [Jessica Marcon](https://github.com/marcontwm)\r\n * [Marcus Ilgner](https://github.com/milgner)\r\n * [Rob Halff](https://github.com/rhalff)\r\n * [Ryan Michael](https://github.com/kerinin/boxroom)\r\n * [Thomas Volkmar Worm](https://github.com/tvw/)\r\n * [Joan Marc Carbo](https://github.com/jmcarbo)\r\n * Stian Haklev\r\n * Craig Box\r\n * [Stephan Toggweiler](https://github.com/rheoli)\r\n * [Kale Worsley](https://github.com/kaleworsley)\r\n * [Arnaud Sellenet](https://github.com/demental)\r\n * [Patrick Fratczak](https://github.com/patfrat)\r\n * [Alessandro Lepore](https://github.com/alepore)\r\n * [Cayce Balara](https://github.com/Yardboy)\r\n\r\nDonations:\r\n\r\n * [IT Partners](http://www.itpartners.co.nz/)\r\n * Matt Meshulam\r\n * April Colo\r\n * [Mohd Sofian](http://www.zulrafique.com.my/)\r\n\r\nIcons:\r\n\r\n * [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 JIIT Students\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the\r\nSoftware, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject\r\nto the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\r\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\r\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
